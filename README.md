## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The objective was to assess whether a new loan approval system improved decision outcomes compared to the current approach. Using **A/B testing in R**, we analysed approval rates, identified inconsistencies, and measured the statistical significance of observed differences.

The analysis focused on:

- Reducing **Type I and Type II errors**  
- Assessing **loan officer consistency**  
- Evaluating **approval accuracy** across control and treatment groups  
- Translating statistical outputs into **strategic business recommendations**

Findings were presented to the Executive Team and Analytics Department in a structured report aimed at guiding implementation decisions.
